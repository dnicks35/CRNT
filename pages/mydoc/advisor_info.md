<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Although you may trust your faculty research advisor to show discretion when requested, there is no mandate that your research advisor acts as a confidential resource for you or maintains confidentiality regarding anything you bring to their attention. </p>
<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with your research advisor, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered “protected activity” by the university; i.e., if you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university’s anti-retaliation policy will not protect you.</p>
<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Faculty research advisors, assuming they are reasonable and decent actors, tend to be your first line of defense when facing issues with other labmates, students, faculty members, and/or administrators. They can provide guidance, help you navigate the conflict at hand, act as facilitators, and advocate on your behalf. They can also escalate the situation to a higher authority if the situation warrants such action. If the conflict you are having is with your faculty advisor, again, assuming a trustworthy, reasonable, and decent actor, you can approach them directly with your issue(s) and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Unfortunately, there are numerous cases in which a faculty advisor may perpetuate harm or not be a trustworthy, reasonable, and decent actor. In such cases, direct confrontation can leave students vulnerable to retaliation and other adverse consequences as they navigate the conflict resolution process.</p>
<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">When preparing to discuss a problem with a faculty advisor, it is beneficial to keep a written record of your engagement by setting up a time to talk via email. Take notes of points you would like to discuss and note their responses. Afterwards, follow up via email about next steps in the conflict resolution process. In cases in which a faculty advisor is perpetuating harm or is not a trustworthy, reasonable, and decent actor, try to have another witness or third party present to corroborate your series of events and, in the case of particularly manipulative advisors, help you combat the effects of actions such as gaslighting. If you feel you are left vulnerable or a situation is made worse by engaging with your research advisor, consider consulting another member of your department such as an associate chair.</p>
