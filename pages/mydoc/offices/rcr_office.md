<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>The Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing education, resources, and guidance on a broad range of ethical issues emerging from research activities. The RCR program helps to administer the Institute's <a href="https://rcr.gatech.edu/policies">three RCR policies</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>https://rcr.gatech.edu/about</p>
   <p>It is difficult to find the person who is the go-to for potentially unethical research or authorship related topics. If you cannot find this person, look at the registrar information for who teaches the mandatory RCR class. The instructor of that course is likely the university's go-to ethics person or will at least be able to put you in contact with them. While this person has very little authority to steer the process of your conflict-resolution, they will be an invaluable source of information. They also likely serve on the committee that investigates these types of issues and will be able to escalate your case if needed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>We recommend talking to this person any time you have even a questionable research ethics issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>his person will likely be quite far removed from the parties involved in your individual conflict. As such it is likely low-risk to consult with them regarding your ethical conflict, but there is no official requirement for confidentiality. If you are concerned, you may anonymize your discussion by not specifying your department or any names. In this way you can get advice and understanding of the complex ethical issues at hand without too much fear of retaliation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>This person will likely not be directly involved in the resolution of your conflict. They can provide you with clarity on what level of unethical issue you are facing: is it a violation of any laws or specific policies? Or is it simply a "sticky area" the university hopes reasonable people would not do? Either way they can provide you with ideas for a path forward and let you know if your case should be escalated. If your case is escalated to the VP for conflict resolution they will likely consult with this party - so it's not a bad idea to have made contact with them and shared your side of the story directly prior to formalizing the complaint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>You may anonymize your discussion of your conflict with this person to whatever level you are comfortable with. Although it is always a good idea to keep a record of any reports of unethical issues or policy violations. It is recommended that you keep notes of the discussion and send a follow-up email to summarize the conflict and the points laid out by the RCR person during your discussion. Be sure to put in writing any policies or codes of conduct that are mentioned that may have been violated. While this discussion is not necessarily "protected activity" it will help your case to have written documentation of a report or conversation which outlines the ethical concerns specifically as it relates to any formal university or USG policies. If you feel that you want to escalate your issue beyond this point, having an informed discussion with the advisor and a third party (one who is ideally not at a power-disadvantage) can be helpful. If you feel that communication with the advisor directly will not be beneficial you should report your concern to EthicsPoint directly. This will ensure that the university does not so easily dismiss your case.</p>
