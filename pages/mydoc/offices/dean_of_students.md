<p>The Dean of Students Office assists students in the resolution of problems, provides information about, and referral to campus resources, and promotes initiatives that address students' needs and interests. In addition the Office provides educational and co-curricular activities and experiences that encourage students to have a positive college experience.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>Those with issues relating generally to being a student (e.g. class absence, leave of absence, grade changes, academic grievances etc.) can contact the Dean of Students Office through an <a href='https://gatech-advocate.symplicity.com/care_report/index.php/pid661935?'>online form</a>.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>The Dean of Students Office will provide you with accommodations for classes. If a professor violates these accommodations, the Office will act on the student's behalf.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">While it may be promised, there is no guarantee that a conversation with this person is confidential. There is no official protection or promise of confidentiality from the university at this level. Promises of confidentiality are worth as much as the word of the faculty serving in this role. They will likely tell you that for them to assist you with this issue they cannot maintain confidentiality as they will need to have conversations with lower levels of administration as well as possibly the advisor.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>
