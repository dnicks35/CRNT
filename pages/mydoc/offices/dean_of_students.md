<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>The Office assists students in the resolution of problems, provides information about and referral to campus resources, and promotes initiatives that address students' needs and interests. In addition the Office provides educational and co-curricular activities and experiences that encourage students to have a positive college experience.</p>
   <p>Their primary purpose for the sake of conflict resolution is to help you negotiate accommodations or absences in case of personal or family emergencies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>https://studentlife.gatech.edu/about/dean-students</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>If you have a family situation or personal emergency, the Dean of Students office will provide your professors (including your advisor, if applicable) with the list of accommodations that they are required to provide for you (for instance, an excused absence, extra days to complete assignments, etc). If a professor violates these accommodations, the Office will act on the student's behalf.</p>
   <p>For long-term situations, they can help you arrange a leave of absence or a withdrawal.</p>
   <p>The Dean of Students has authority over OSI. Contact this individual (rather than the office) if an OSI-related issue is not being handled efficiently or thoroughly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>Part of the purpose of getting an accommodation through the Dean of Students Office is to preserve the privacy of the individual experiencing the emergency. The Dean will contact your professor informing them of the university-approved accommodations they are required to provide, but will not inform the professor about the nature of the emergency. You are not required to provide details to your professors about your personal situation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>The Dean of Students Office will provide you with a note to present to your professor with your approved accommodations. If a professor violates these accommodations, the Office will act on the student's behalf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>Those with issues relating generally to being a student (e.g. class absence, leave of absence, grade changes, academic grievances etc.) can contact the Dean of Students Office through an <a href="https://gatech-advocate.symplicity.com/care_report/index.php/pid661935?">online form</a>.</p>
   <p>For escalating from OSI-related concerns, you can contact the Dean of Students themselves, directly. You can find their name on the Dean of Students Office website and search for their contact information in the Georgia Tech directory.</p>
