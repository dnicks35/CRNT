<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>You should ask your Graduate Academic Advisor for assistance if you are uncertain of the forms and deadlines that are required for your degree completion. They may also be able to help you identify other administrators with the authority to assist you in other concerns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>It is this person's choice whether they choose to keep a conversation confidential, although you may request their discretion.</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>Contact them early! Academic advisors have periods of the semester where they are inundated with last-minute, urgent requests. Give them plenty of time to respond to you and things will go smoothly. Follow up by email or in person in a week if you still haven't received a response.</p>
