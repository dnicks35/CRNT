<p>The Vice Provost for Advocacy and Conflict-Resolution may be the person/department that is best informed about the different conflict resolution processes and outcomes that exist at Georgia Tech. When speaking to the Vice Provost, you can ask for information and/or an informal resolution process or conduct a formal resolution process. A formal process involves a full investigation, which includes a legal team and may take a long time. However, the decision of the Vice Provost is binding and must be enforced by the Department Chair. Pursuing informal resolution processes may include mediation talks with the supervision of the Vice Provost or referrals to other individuals, departments, or offices.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">While it may be promised, there is no guarantee that a conversation with this person is confidential. There is no official protection or promise of confidentiality from the university at this level. Promises of confidentiality are worth as much as the word of the faculty serving in this role. They will likely tell you that for them to assist you with this issue they cannot maintain confidentiality as they will need to have conversations with lower levels of administration as well as possibly the advisor.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>While the Vice Provost is well-informed and has authority, this is not necessarily the same thing as being a student advocate. Some policies may be friendlier to the university than the graduate student, and the Vice Provost will inform you of them plainly and is not likely to provide workarounds. However, the policies that do exist, the Vice Provost for Conflict Resolution will hold to. The Vice Provost will encourage informal, mediation-type approaches rather than formal options; if you have already engaged in such approaches or if you want more formal and/or legal procedures to be enacted, you may want to come prepared to steer the conversation in that direction. A formal claim is likely to help future students more than it helps you; it initiates a slow but more thorough process than the informal route, and prevents your issue from getting lost due to lack of documentation.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>The best use of the Vice Provost's office may be to inform the Department Chair about what options they have for addressing a conflict that has already been brought up. Decide in advance if you want to initiate formal conflict resolution processes, or if you'd like to hear about all your options first.</p>
