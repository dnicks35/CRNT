<p>EH&S enforces good health and safety practices around campus. Report unsafe working conditions to this department.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>If a situation is actively dangerous, make sure to clear the area before reporting to EH&S. For serious injuries or emergencies, you should also call 911.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>EH&S will investigate your report of safety violations. If a valid safety threat is identified, they will inform the proper stakeholders of the violation and how it should be rectified. Follow-up communications from EH&S will ensure that the issue does not persist. There are rarely ramifications for safety violations since there are no specific institute policies.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">While it may be promised, there is no guarantee that a conversation with this person is confidential. There is no official protection or promise of confidentiality from the university at this level. Promises of confidentiality are worth as much as the word of the faculty serving in this role. They will likely tell you that for them to assist you with this issue they cannot maintain confidentiality as they will need to have conversations with lower levels of administration as well as possibly the advisor.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>
