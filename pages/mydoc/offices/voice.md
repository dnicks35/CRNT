<p>The <a href="https://wellnesscenter.gatech.edu/voice">VOICE Office</a> supports victims/survivors of sexual harassment or violence, including prevention initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>In an emergency, you can contact a VOICE Advocate (or other recommended professional) 24hr/day at the phone number on <a href="https://wellnesscenter.gatech.edu/voice/what-do-if-you-have-experienced-sexual-or-relationship-violence">this website</a>. Alternative emergency resources and contacts are also listed on the webpage.</p>
   <p>For non-urgent concerns, you will schedule an appointment with a VOICE Advocate who will listen to your story and present you with the legal, academic, and counseling options that are available to you. They will support you in the decision you make and may refer you to one or more relevant offices that can handle your case (e.g. the Office of Student Integrity, Title IX coordinator, etc) or support your wellbeing (e.g. CARE, Counseling, the Women's or LGBTQIA+ Resource Center). They may offer to join you on any follow-up phone calls or meetings for support, but will not take action without your permission, intervene in any meetings, and will leave all decisions up to you, providing counsel as to your best course of action minimalistically and only upon request.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>This office is a great way to get connected with other offices and systems that can support you. On their own, they will be good listeners but will not take action for youâ€”so if you're looking for confidentiality, this is a great place to go, but if you want action, you will have to follow their referrals to their partners.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Yes</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>
