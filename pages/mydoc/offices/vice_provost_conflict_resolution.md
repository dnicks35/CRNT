<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>The Vice Provost for Advocacy and Conflict-Resolution may be the person/department that is best informed about the different conflict resolution processes and outcomes that exist at Georgia Tech. When speaking to the Vice Provost, you can ask for information, an informal resolution process, or to initiate a formal conflict resolution process. A formal process involves a full investigation, which includes a legal team and may take a long time. However, the decision of the VP for Conflict Resolution is binding and must be enforced by the Department Chair. Pursuing informal resolution processes may include mediation talks under the supervision of the VP for Conflict Resolution, or referrals to other individuals, departments or offices.</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>The Assistant Vice Provost for Advocacy and Conflict-Resolution is able to inform you about the conflict resolution options that are available to you and the processes associated with them. They are able to mediate and to initiate a formal or informal conflict.</p>
   <p>If you submit a formal report through EthicsPoint, this automatically goes to a triage team that includes the VP for Conflict Resolution, among others. If you have an ethical concern or a policy violation, reporting through EthicsPoint will automatically inform the VP for Conflict Resolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>You may request confidentiality, although it is not binding until the formal resolution process has begun (assuming that the formal process requires it). Still, you may be informed that for them to assist you with your issue, you must not request confidentiality, as it will restrict them from having conversations with the relevant parties.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the formal resolution process may require them to maintain confidentiality about the specific actions that were taken as a result of your complaint. This means you may not see visible signs that your complaint was acted upon, aside from a message reporting that your case has been closed. This can be frustrating, but note that progressive discipline means that any future reports of similar wrongdoing will be acted upon more promptly and severely, even if you are unable to see changes while you are still involved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>The VP for Conflict Resolution is well-informed and has authority to handle issues such as policy violations that require disciplinary action and not merely mediation. As many of the formal issues handled by this office are legal and ethical complaints, the information that you get is likely to be legally phrased and very accurate. Some policies may be friendlier to the university than the graduate student, and the Vice Provost will inform you of them plainly. However, the policies that exist, the Vice Provost for Conflict Resolution will hold to.</p>
   <p>For issues that fall short of the legal, ethical, or policy violations that the VP for Conflict Resolution must resolve formally, the Vice Provost will encourage informal, mediation-type approaches. If you have already engaged in such approaches or if you want more formal and/or legal procedures to be enacted, you may want to come prepared to steer the conversation in that direction, or initiate your report via EthicsPoint. Note that a formal claim is likely to help future students more than it helps you; it initiates a slow, but more thorough process than the informal route and prevents your issue from getting lost due to lack of documentation.</p>
   <p>As stated above, the formal resolution process may require the VP for Conflict Resolution to maintain confidentiality about the specific actions that were taken as a result of your complaint. In cases where "progressive discipline" was initiated (e.g. the offending party received a warning not to continue -- see https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/employment/progressive-discipline for details), you may not see visible signs that your complaint was acted upon, aside from a message reporting that your case has been closed (this will come through EthicsPoint if you have used it to file your report). This can be frustrating, but note that progressive discipline means that any future reports of similar wrongdoing will be acted upon more promptly and severely, even if you are unable to see changes while you are still involved.</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>The best direct use of this office (given that reports made through EthicsPoint will also make their way here) may be to gather information about your options if this tool cannot provide the information you need. (Much of the information on this website was sourced from the VP for Conflict Resolution's office.) Going into meetings with other GT offices and staff with information about the powers, procedures, and policies relevant to your conflict can facilitate a more rapid (and hopefully politer and lower-stress) resolution.</p>
   <p>If you already know that you want to initiate formal conflict resolution processes, you should probably do so through EthicsPoint. Go to this office directly if you'd like to hear about all your alternative options first, or if you would like informal mediation to be conducted via a legally authoritative office.</p>
