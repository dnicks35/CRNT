<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>If you are a Ph.D. student or a Master's student pursuing a thesis-based degree, then you probably already have a research advisor. (If not, see the <a href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/find_advisor.html">Finding an Advisor</a> page.) Your advisor is likely the person who will have the highest impact on your experience in graduate school and is usually your first resource for most of the academic and workplace problems that you experience.</p>
   <p>Your research advisor has many roles: PI, grant writer, instructor, communications liaison with outside sponsors, research collaborator, committee member, etc., but one of their most important ones is their role advising and mentoring graduate students. It is recommended that when you first enter a lab, you discuss their mentoring style and make sure you both are on the same page about each other's needs and expectations. A baseline set of expectations for this conversation can be found <a href="https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/graduate/expectations/">here</a>. It may be worth revisiting your mutual expectations yearly and adjusting them to better fit your current goals and needs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>Unlike most of the people in this directory, you should already be having conversations with your advisor on a regular basis. (The exact rate and format differs from advisor to advisor, but you should go over this when you discuss your mutual expectations, as mentioned above.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>Your advisor is often the first place to go to for any issue that pertains to your research success, and (depending on your relationship) can provide support and guidance for issues outside of lab as well. Because they are often a student's first point of contact, it is important that advisors know what resources to direct students to when a conflict cannot be resolved through their authority alone. This Conflict Resolution Tool is intended to help advisors as well as students to navigate the complex tableau of graduate student issues and access needed resources.</p>
   <p>Many issues can be resolved directly through an advisor's intervention, and we have endeavored to clarify which issues these are, so that you can have realistic expectations if your concern falls outside of that list. If your advisor does not have the direct authority to resolve your concern, but you have a good relationship with your advisor, then it is still recommended to talk to them before pursuing other avenues of conflict resolution: they may be able to support you indirectly.</p>
   <p>As for any conflict, your path to a resolution will be faster if you come to your conversation prepared with a list of resources and courses of action that are relevant to your situation. If your advisor is unfamiliar with the type of issue you are facing or does not have the direct authority to resolve it, it will likely save time if you can provide this information up front, during your meeting. If the advisor is well-informed and able to take action on your situation, it may be better to allow them to suggest a solution and for you to provide alternatives afterwards as needed. Because of the power differential between advisors and students, if an advisor is able to help you with your conflict, the solution they propose is likely to be more subtle and efficient than the pathways you can enact.</p>
   <p>Issues you may wish to discuss with your advisor:</p> 
   <ul>
      <li>Conflicts with lab mates or research peers</li>
      <li>Conflicts with post-docs in the lab</li>
      <li>Funding concerns</li>
      <li>Fellowship applications</li>
      <li>Graduation requirements</li>
      <li>Unfair treatment by Quals or Dissertation Committee</li>
      <li>Improper or unethical handling of research, research funds, or misattribution of research credit</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Conflicts that can likely be resolved by this person:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Any conflict that involves your advisor can theoretically be solved by your advisor if you are able to reach an agreement with them.</li>
      <li>Conflicts involving other members of the lab can be managed by the advisor, although in severe cases, higher authorities may need to be involved.</li>
      <li>Funding issues can be resolved by the advisor, who can include you on an already-existing grant (GRA), plan fellowship/grant funding applications or internships with you in advance, or appeal to the department for a GTA position on your behalf. If your advisor does not resolve your funding concerns, you can escalate to the next person up the chain, <a href="finances_layout.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Graduation milestones such as the qualification exams are usually scheduled by the department, so while your advisor can advocate for you, they are not the person who will resolve a quals conflict themselves. Conflicts concerning your graduation timeline (i.e. what can be in my thesis? When can I propose and defend? What is the minimum research contribution required for graduation?) can be resolved by your advisor. If your advisor does not resolve your graduation timeline concerns, you can escalate to the next person up the chain, <a href="graduation_layout.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Unethical research practices, including misattribution of credit or misappropriation of research funds, can be resolved by your advisor. If your advisor does not resolve your concerns about unethical research practices, you can escalate to the next person up the chain, <a href="research_ethics_layout.html">here</a>.</li>
   </ul>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>Although you may trust your faculty research advisor to show discretion when requested, there is no mandate that your research advisor acts as a confidential resource for you or maintains confidentiality regarding anything you bring to their attention.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>Faculty research advisors, assuming they are reasonable and decent actors, tend to be your first line of defense when facing issues with other labmates, students, faculty members, and/or administrators. They can provide guidance, help you navigate the conflict at hand, act as facilitators, and advocate on your behalf. They can also escalate the situation to a higher authority if the situation warrants such action. If the conflict you are having is with your faculty advisor, then, again assuming that they are a trustworthy, reasonable, and decent actor, you can approach them directly with your issue(s) and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Unfortunately, there are numerous cases in which a faculty advisor may perpetuate harm or not be a trustworthy, reasonable, and decent actor. In such cases, direct confrontation can leave students vulnerable to retaliation and other adverse consequences as they navigate the conflict resolution process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>When preparing to discuss a problem with a faculty advisor, it is beneficial to be professional and polite, using <a href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/difficult_conversations.html">standard practices for engaging in difficult conversations</a>. As much as possible, try to keep the conversation framed as a collaboration to solve a problem. It is also recommended, as with any conflict, to keep a written record: set up a time to talk via email, and send a follow-up email afterwards with your notes and the agreed-upon action items, as well as the expected timeline for their completion. Schedule a check-in with your advisor afterwards to ensure that progress on both sides is being made in an appropriate time frame.</p>
   <p>In cases in which a faculty advisor is perpetuating harm or is not a trustworthy, reasonable, and decent actor, try to have a third-party person, preferably with some authority higher than your advisor, present in the meeting. This person can act as a witness to corroborate your version of events and their presence may be a mediating influence. In the case of particularly manipulative advisors, this witness may also help you combat the effects of actions such as gaslighting. If you feel you are left vulnerable or a situation is made worse by engaging directly with your research advisor, consider consulting another member of your department instead. You can find alternatives pertinent to your particular situation on the <a href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/problem-identification.html">List of Conflicts</a> page. Typical alternatives will include persons such as the Ombudsman or your department's Associate Chair.</p>
