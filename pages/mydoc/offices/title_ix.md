<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination in educational programs or activities at any institutions that receive federal funding. The Title IX office handles cases of gender discrimination, as well as more serious offenses such as sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, relationship violence, and sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>Submit a Title IX report through EthicsPoint (preferred method), or reach out to their office or contact one of the coordinators directly (including deputy coordinators).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>According to <a href="https://diversity.gatech.edu/equity-compliance/reporting-options/am-i-responsible-employee">this website</a>, if you are a Responsible Employee, you are mandated to report any cases of known or suspected sexual misconduct to the Title IX office.</p>
   <p>You can also reach out to this office for other cases of gender-based discrimination, including discrimination based on pregnancy or sexual orientation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>No. Even "confidential employees" are required to report the general incident type, time, and location of sexual assault cases. Sometimes they must provide even more details in order to ensure campus safety. If you make your own report to the Title IX office, they will require information about the identity of the victim and the perpetrator in order to move forward with the investigation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>Reporting this activity to the Title IX office will open a formal investigation. Title IX offenses are taken very seriously compared to other university complaints, so this office has considerable influence. Depending on the circumstances, a formal hearing or an informal resolution are available options. In a hearing, the standard of proof is "a preponderance of the evidence;" and a student found responsible faces disciplinary action up to and including suspension or expulsion. If the alleged perpetrator is a faculty or staff member, a complaint should be filed with the Office of Human Resources or through the Institute's EthicsPoint web page. You may file a confidential report through the VOICE Advocates. Contact information can be found on the VOICE website. This option will not result in a report to the Institute or an investigation unless the student chooses. If you choose to keep your report confidential, the Advocates are only required to report de-identified data for purposes of crime statistics reports under the Clery Act. You can also report to GTPD who can open a criminal investigation.</p>
   <p>If you choose to report to a non-confidential resource, the Institute is required by federal law to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and take any remedial action deemed necessary to preserve your safety and that of the Institute community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>There is always a VOICE Advocate on call during the day, after-hours, and on weekends. The advocates are trained in crisis response and can provide immediate information and resources. You are not required to file a formal complaint or provide the name of your perpetrator in order to receive support services from the VOICE Advocate. You can receive health care (like medications to prevent infections or pregnancy) at any facility. Timely medical evaluation may also be crucial to obtain evidence in criminal or civil proceedings. Grady Hospital, however, is the only facility with nurses who are specially trained to collect evidence from victims of sexual assault, and this evidence collection must occur within 120 hours of the assault. The care you receive after a sexual assault is as confidential as any other health care and will not be reported to the police or the Institute unless you want it reported. If the circumstances warrant, GT Police may issue a criminal trespass warning, prohibiting entrance onto Institute property. In addition, the Office of the Dean of Students and the Institute's Title IX Coordinator can assist with academic and housing accommodations. The VOICE Advocate can assist students in communicating with these offices. If you file an Institute Complaint (see below), you may also be able to obtain an interim "no contact order" through the Office of Student Integrity, which orders the parties to refrain from in-person or electronic contact with each other while your complaint is investigated and resolved. Violation of the no contact order is enforceable through the Institute's Code of Conduct. Protective Order: In some cases, you may be able to seek a protective order from a judge. A protective order can be enforced anywhere in the United States, no matter where you obtain it, and its violation can result in criminal charges. The VOICE Advocate and/ or GT Police can provide information and support to those interested in filing for a protective order.</p>
   <p>For less urgent complaints, file a report through EthicsPoint and it will be routed to the Title IX office. If more information is required in order to pursue the investigation, they will request it, but you will need to keep the record number that is given to you in order to read their responses.</p>
