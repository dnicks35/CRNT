<p>Go to GTPD to report violations of law. Report your conflicts here if you would like to initiate a criminal investigation.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>Any reports you make to GTPD you may also report to the relevant on-campus authorities. For example, you may report cases of sexual assault to the Title IX office in parallel with your official police report. Be prepared to provide the police department with any information you have that can help with their investigation.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>All reports to GTPD involving another student will be forwarded to OSI. GTPD will be asked to investigate when it is deemed necessary. Other reports not involving a student will be investigated regularly.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Confidentiality is limited to that provided by law. Because police reports are public records under state law, GTPD cannot hold reports of crime in confidence. Confidential reports, for purposes of inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics, can be made to Campus Security Authorities.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Yes. You are protected when you bring potential legal violations to the police.</p>
