<p>EthicsPoint is a USG portal that is used so that USG can monitor ethical issues at all the universities under their domain. USG does not get involved with the resolution of issues at this level, but they do apply pressure to the university to resolve the issue (which can make a large difference in the university taking your case seriously). Submitting to EthicsPoint will help get your case to the correct office within GT that is most adept at handling your issue. Furthermore, the university is not allowed to close your case without your consent (they might attempt to do so anyways, but you can demand it stay open until you feel they have properly addressed your concern).</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Document everything as best you can and update the EthicsPoint system with any new information regarding your case as it comes along. Do not feel afraid to submit your case to EthicsPoint as compared to taking it to an administrator directly. EthicsPoint will only route your case to either that person or a more capable administrator. Bottom line: if you are set on reporting your case to any member of administration, submitting to EthicsPoint will likely only save you time and better protect you from retaliation.</p>
   <p class="answer">Administrators might discourage you from escalating to EthicsPoint by claiming that it might make the situation worse or be too "dramatic" a reaction for your claim. This is not true. It is an attempt to dismiss your case and defer accountability. Given that you are going to report your case at all, reporting to EthicsPoint will not make it worse for you.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">EthicsPoint will route your conflict to the appropriate office to handle your concern. This office will handle the issue as they normally would. Reporting to EthicsPoint will likely decrease the amount of time it takes to resolve your issue (as USG monitors the duration of time a case is open), but it still could be months.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Reports to EthicsPoint are supposed to be confidential. Depending on your conflict, it might be impossible to maintain your anonymity (e.g. if you're the only minority student in your lab and your concern is related to your status as a minority).</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Reports to EthicsPoint are considered to be protected activity under the anti-retaliation policy. Reporting your case to EthicsPoint, even when you are unsure of any policy or code of conduct violations might be the best thing you can do to ensure you are protected from retaliation. To be clear, this will not necessarily keep your advisor or perpetrator from retaliating against you, but it will allow any retaliation that takes place following your claim to be seen as such from a legal perspective by the university. Simply, if you report to EthicsPoint and someone retaliates against you they can be held accountable. If you do not report to EthicsPoint and keep your reports limited to informal resolution process and academic administration only, it is unlikely any perpetrators will be held accountable for retaliating against you.</p>
