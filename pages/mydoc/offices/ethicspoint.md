<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>EthicsPoint is a USG portal that is used so that USG can monitor ethical issues at all the universities under their domain. USG does not get involved with the resolution of issues at this level, but they do apply pressure to the university to resolve the issue (which can make a large difference in the university taking your case seriously). Submitting to EthicsPoint will help get your case to the correct office within GT that is most adept at handling your issue. Furthermore, the university is not allowed to close your case without your consent (they might attempt to do so anyways, but you can demand it stay open until you feel they have properly addressed your concern).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>Report violations of ethics, law, university policy, or financial mismanagement through this portal. Conflicts that arise between individuals that do not constitute a breach of policy are not intended for this portal; however, the triage team handles every report that is filed and attempts to route it to the appropriate department.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>Reports to EthicsPoint are supposed to be confidential. Depending on your conflict, it might be impossible to maintain your anonymity (e.g. if you're the only minority student in your lab and your concern is related to your status as a minority). Also note that some conflicts (e.g. Title IX reports) require a non-anonymous report.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person considered protected activity?</b></p>
   <p>Reports to EthicsPoint are considered to be protected activity under the anti-retaliation policy. Reporting your case to EthicsPoint automatically documents your complaint for the legal team and treats it as though it may be a policy violation, both of which are required to invoke the non-retaliation policy.</p>
   <p>To be clear, this will not necessarily keep your advisor or perpetrator from retaliating against you, but it will allow any retaliation that takes place following your claim to be seen as such from a legal perspective by the university. Violating the anti-retaliation policy is a big deal and can result in severe disciplinary action.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>EthicsPoint will route your conflict to the appropriate office to handle your concern. This office will handle the issue as they normally would. Reporting to EthicsPoint will likely decrease the amount of time it takes to resolve your issue (as USG monitors the duration of time a case is open), but a formal complaint must be handled through the proper legal channels, and could take months to investigate and resolve.</p>
   <p>Updates will be posted on the EthicsPoint portal, so keep your record number when it is first given to you so you can access the updates. If you have reported anonymously, this is especially important, as it is the only way the university can contact you to update you on the status of your complaint. Do note that full details regarding the actions taken to resolve your complaint may not be provided to you, based on legal or university protocols.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>Document everything as best you can and update the EthicsPoint system with any new information regarding your case as it comes along. Note that if you intend to report anonymously, you will need to redact the documentation you provide; however, there are cases in which anonymity reduces the actions that can be taken on your behalf. If you are unsure, you can report anonymously at first: if the triage team who is evaluating your report believes that your claim can be better acted upon if you provide de-anonymizing information, they will inform you through the EthicsPoint portal. (You will need to retain your record number in order to read any messages and updates, so don't lose it!)</p>
   <p>Do not feel afraid to submit your case to EthicsPoint instead of taking it to an administrator directly. If you have a complaint that could be an ethics or policy violation, EthicsPoint will only route your case to either that person or a more capable administrator. You may be told that submitting a claim is an overreaction, but a good faith report is not an overreaction, and reports made while an issue is still concerning but not illegal can allow problems to be solved while they are still relatively minor. Reporting also provides documentation that allows patterns to be identified, facilitating a faster and more complete response if the problem continues to worsen. <u>Bottom line</u>: if you are set on reporting your case to any member of administration, submitting to EthicsPoint will likely only save you time and better protect you from retaliation. Given that you are going to report your case at all, reporting to EthicsPoint will not make it worse for you.</p>
