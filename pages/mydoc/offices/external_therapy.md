<p><a href="https://github.gatech.edu/pages/ehariharan3/apollo.github.io/care.html">CARE</a> is a free on-campus resource provided to you for assessing your mental health needs and referring you to resources that can help, but you are not required to use them. You can bypass CARE entirely if you so choose and go straight to off-campus mental healthcare providers. Check your insurance coverage, and then go to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists?search=30332">this website</a> to look for therapists or psychologists in your area.</p>

<p>Things you might want to pay attention to while you search for therapists: you can screen by gender, race, faith, or other attributes that might  make you more comfortable. You might also consider looking up therapists who specialize in your mental health condition (assuming you know it) or in particular styles of therapy. One of the most common and effective styles of therapy currently in practice is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which focuses on correcting inaccurate and unhelpful thought patterns, but there are alternative options such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (for emotional management strategies), and others that may be particularly helpful for a specific condition. It may be helpful to do a web search for therapies that are recommended for specific mental health conditions, if you know what you'd like to be treated for. If you don't, don't worry too much about it. Before you get started with a therapist, you'll have an initial appointment or possibly even a pre-appointment where you'll talk with the therapist about your situation and concerns. If they believe you may have a situation that would require something specific or something that they cannot provide, they will inform you and can usually make referrals to another practice.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that you do not need to stick with the therapist you start with. It's common for the first few sessions to be uncomfortable—depending on the kind of discomfort, this may even be a good thing—so don't give up on therapy altogether if you have a first session or two that don't seem helpful. If after a few weeks you don't feel like things are progressing, you can politely let them know that you don't plan to do a follow-up and can go back to the website to find another therapist. (A personal note: I went through five therapists before I found one that worked for me.)</p>
