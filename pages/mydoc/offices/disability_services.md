<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>The Office of Disability Services collaborates with students, faculty, and staff to create a campus environment that is usable, equitable, sustainable, and inclusive of all members of the Georgia Tech community. If students encounter academic, physical, technological, or other barriers on campus, the Disability Services team collaborates with the student to find creative solutions and reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>Students requesting accommodations must register with the Office of Disability Services, provide documentation of their disability from healthcare provider and complete the <a href="https://bear.accessiblelearning.com/gatech/">online application</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>Yes. Your disability status is protected under FERPA meaning that it cannot be disclosed to a third party. GT can share this information with other faculty and staff for educational purposes though. So within the university it is not necessarily confidential, but legally this information cannot be given out to someone who does not need to know (like your instructor).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>The office will provide you with accommodations for classes. If a professor violates these accommodations, the Office of Disability Services will act on the student's behalf.</p>
