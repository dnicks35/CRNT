<p>The Office of Disability Services collaborates with students, faculty, and staff to create a campus environment that is usable, equitable, sustainable, and inclusive of all members of the Georgia Tech community. If students encounter academic, physical, technological, or other barriers on campus, the Disability Services team collaborates with the student to find creative solutions and reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Yes. Your disability status is protected under FERPA meaning that it cannot be disclosed to a third party. GT can share this information with other faculty and staff for educational purposes, though. So within the university it is not necessarily confidential, but legally this information cannot be given out to someone who does not need to know (like your instructor).</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>Office will provide you with accommodations for classes. If a professor violates these accommodations, the Office of Disability Services will act on the student's behalf.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>Students requesting accommodations must register with the Office of Disability Services, provide documentation of their disability from healthcare provider and complete the <a href="https://bear.accessiblelearning.com/gatech/">online application</a>.</p>
