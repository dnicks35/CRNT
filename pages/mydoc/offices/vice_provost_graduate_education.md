<p>The Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education supports the needs of graduate students and postdocs and will advocate for you on your behalf.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>This office is effectively only used if the offices below it have been unresponsive/unhelpful. If you need to escalate beyond the Vice Provost of Advocacy and Conflict Resolution, you will go to this office.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>This office can likely put some pressure on the offices below it to push your case along. </p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">While it may be promised, there is no guarantee that a conversation with this person is confidential. There is no official protection or promise of confidentiality from the university at this level. Promises of confidentiality are worth as much as the word of the faculty serving in this role. They will likely tell you that for them to assist you with this issue they cannot maintain confidentiality as they will need to have conversations with lower levels of administration as well as possibly the advisor.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>
