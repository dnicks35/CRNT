<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>Georgia Tech Human Resources (GTHR) serves employees through strategic counsel and employee engagement. GTHR is responsible for advising employees regarding work performance and conflict management.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>https://careers.gatech.edu/contact-us</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>If you believe that a Georgia Tech employee has violated a policy while on campus or acting on behalf of the university.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>While it may be promised, there is no guarantee that a conversation with this person is confidential. There is no official protection or promise of confidentiality from the university at this level. Promises of confidentiality are worth as much as the word of the faculty serving in this role. They will likely tell you that for them to assist you with this issue they cannot maintain confidentiality as they will need to have conversations with lower levels of administration as well as possibly the advisor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>If GTHR has determined that a policy was violated, they will conduct their own internal investigation which may require multiple interviews with you and the offending party. Be aware that getting GTHR involved will likely end your relationship with the offending party as you are putting their job on the line, so if the offending party is your advisor, then be prepared to change advisors; if the offending party is an instructor, then be prepared to drop the class; etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>A Georgia Tech grad student is technically not an "employee" by GTHR's definition and consequently are not given the full rights and protections that other employees of the university are granted. Because of this, you must make a very strong case when contacting GTHR that the offending party has violated some institute policy. If you have experienced a policy violation, make sure to document your conflict. Keep emails, text messages, possibly even phone recordings -- anything which can help to support your case.</p>
