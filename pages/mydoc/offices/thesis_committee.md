<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>Your thesis committee is formed before your Ph.D./M.S. Proposal. These members agree on what remaining work is sufficient to earn your degree, and should be used as a resource when issues arise related to the completion of proposed thesis work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>Contact your thesis committee members if you believe that your academic progress has been hindered in some way. This could be in regards to unsafe working conditions, unreasonable expectations, delayed graduation, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>It is this person's choice whether they choose to keep a conversation confidential, although you may request their discretion. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>Your thesis committee will contact your advisor to discuss your academic progress and progress towards completing the items in your Ph.D./M.S. proposal. Some of the discussion may occur at a presentation of your research.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
