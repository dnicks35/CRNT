<p>CARE is the go-to office on-campus for any mental health concerns or issues, for everything from stress management to suicidal thoughts to screening for learning disabilities that may require university accommodations. Depending on the timing and severity of your concern, you can contact them by phone at (404) 894-3498 or using their walk-in hours (Smithgall Student Services Building first floor, Suite 102B, 353 Ferst DR NW Atlanta GA 30313), as described on their <a href="https://mentalhealth.gatech.edu/">website</a>. You are also encouraged to refer friends and acquaintances to CARE if you have concerns about their mental health.</p>

<p>Be aware that walk-ins often involve a long wait in the office. If you have a crowded schedule and an urgent need, you may want to make an appointment, call the emergency line, or reach out to an external therapist directly. Typically, your first appointment at CARE will involve filling out forms followed by a one-on-one, in-person assessment. Depending on your situation, you may be referred to a group stress-reduction workshop, a personal on-campus counselor, or both. More rarely, emergency care services may be suggested. CARE can also provide referrals to psychiatrists’ offices, but this is not done in the initial assessment except upon request.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: medication for mental health issues can only be provided by a psychiatrist, not a psychologist/therapist and not by a STAMPS primary care physician. If you suspect you may need medication, neither STAMPS nor CARE has a direct pathway to a psychiatrist but can provide recommendations upon request.</p>

<p>CARE counseling services are often convenient for students on-campus, but it’s important to realize that this is not your only option for therapy. Standard GT Healthcare plans provide access to online therapy through your <a href="https://myaccount.uhcsr.com/mybenefits">United Healthcare Insurance Portal</a> and to off-campus in-network providers for a $20 (as of 2021) copay per session. You can choose this option whether or not you are offered individual on-campus counseling, if you don’t feel you are benefiting much from your on-campus CARE counselor, or if the CARE counselors are already fully booked with other students. For more information on seeking counseling outside of CARE, refer to the <a href="external_therapy.html">External Therapy page</a>.</p>
