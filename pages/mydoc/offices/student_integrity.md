<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>The Office of Student Integrity handles complaints about student conduct, including academic (e.g. cheating, plagiarism) and non-academic (i.e. bullying, harassment) issues. Problems are reported via the website and judged by either a Student Conduct Administrator or a Student Conduct Panel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>https://osi.gatech.edu/</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>Academic conduct complaints are usually initiated by TAs or professors. You will likely only go to this office on your own for peer-to-peer issues such as non-sexual harassment, stalking, or cyber bullying.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>No confidentiality information was provided on the website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>OSI's main tool for handling non-academic conduct violations is the Non-Contact Directive -- essentially a verbal restraining order that goes both ways. If issues are too minor to require an NCD, they can support mediation; if issues are too major, they can recommend police involvement or a Title IX intervention, whichever is more appropriate. If this is the issue you are going to OSI to resolve, be very thorough with your documentation, and recognize that they will follow through with disciplinary action only given a clear and well-documented violation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>You can initiate a complaint either through their online form or by arranging a meeting with an OSI staff member, though the latter will likely only happen if you have been referred to them directly by another office. It is recommended that you be extremely thorough with your documentation (including texts, emails, pictures, testimonials from secondary witnesses, etc), get instructions from OSI in writing (including rules and timelines), cross-reference their own words in future communications, and meet with them in person as much as possible (with follow-up emails for documentation) to ensure that important information is actually delivered. It may be necessary to escalate to the Dean of Students if they cannot help you in a timely fashion, communicate needed information, or follow through on stated consequences. If they have reasons they say they must wait to intervene on your behalf -- using "intervention" to mean "consequences" and not "threats of consequences" -- and the situation is unsafe, call 911 (if applicable), escalate immediately to the Dean of Students and/or initiate alternative strategies such as a Leave of Absence or switching to a new lab.</p>
