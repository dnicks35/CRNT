<p>The Office of Student Integrity handles complaints about both academic (e.g. cheating, plagiarism) and non-academic (i.e. bullying, harassment) issues. Problems are reported via the <a href="https://osi.gatech.edu/">website</a> and judged by either a Student Conduct Administrator or a Student Conduct Panel. Academic conduct complaints are usually initiated by TAs or professors. You will likely only go to this office on your own for peer-to-peer issues such as non-sexual harassment, stalking, or cyber bullying.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p>You can initiate a complaint either through their online form or by arranging a meeting with an OSI staff member (this latter will likely only happen if you have been referred to them directly by another office). This office behaves as though it is overworked and does not have the time for protracted or nuanced conflicts. Hopefully it now has better resources, but it is recommended that you be extremely thorough with your documentation (including texts, emails, pictures, testimonials from secondary witnesses, etc), get instructions from OSI in writing (including rules and timelines), cross-reference their own words in future communications, and meet with them in person as much as possible (with follow-up emails for documentation) to ensure that important information is actually delivered. It may be necessary to escalate to the Dean of Students if they cannot help you in a timely fashion, communicate needed information, or follow through on stated consequences. If they have reasons they say they must wait to intervene on your behalf—using "intervention" to mean "consequences" and not "threats of consequences"—and the situation is unsafe, escalate immediately to the Dean of Students and/or initiate alternative strategies such as a Leave of Absence or switching to a new lab.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>OSI's main tool for handling non-academic conduct violations is the Non-Contact Directive—essentially a verbal restraining order that goes both ways. If issues are too minor to require an NCD, they can support mediation; if issues are too major, they can recommend police involvement or a Title IX intervention, whichever is more appropriate. Unless things have changed since 2019, the office relies mostly on the threat of consequences rather than on follow-through, which might prove problematic. Communication may be laggy, or may shift meaning after listening to both sides without a follow-up that updates the original complainant. A meeting with an OSI staff member is initiated upon any reported infraction by either party, but disciplinary consequences are only applied when rules are incontrovertibly broken that have no ambiguity in their phrasing. Clarification of the rules in order to reduce ambiguity may not be provided in writing, and if it is provided, may not be transmitted to both parties or may arrive after weeks of delay. Privacy for the accused may prevent communication of outcomes and decisions to the complainant, even in cases where there are acknowledged safety issues for the complainant.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">While it may be promised, there is no guarantee that a conversation with this person is confidential. There is no official protection or promise of confidentiality from the university at this level. Promises of confidentiality are worth as much as the word of the faculty serving in this role. They will likely tell you that for them to assist you with this issue they cannot maintain confidentiality as they will need to have conversations with lower levels of administration as well as possibly the advisor.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>
