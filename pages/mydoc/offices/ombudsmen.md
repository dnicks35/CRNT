<p>The ombudsman (for graduate students) can be found on the Vice Provost's website. Note: there are different ombudsmen for faculty so be sure you have the right one. The ombudsmen are retired university faculty. This is by design such that they have a good understanding of the academic process and systems but have "nothing to lose" and are as unbiased a party as you might get (from someone who was a tenured faculty member before).</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Ombudsmen generally take promises of confidentiality more seriously, although there is no binding enforcement to be confidential at this level.</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered "protected activity" by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>

<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p>The Ombudsmen are not student advocates, although they tend to often serve as such. This is due to the inherent power imbalance involved in navigating the conflict-resolution process as a student vs. faculty (being resolved by faculty). Since they are least likely to be biased they are also most likely to advocate for a resolution that is fair to you. They will likely be aware of resources and options available to you that you would not be made aware of otherwise and can help facilitate them. Other university administration will probably have to participate in the process, but a resolution pushed forward by an ombudsmen has some weight over the university administration at lower levels (Chair and below) because they report directly to the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Post-Docs.</p>

<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
   <p><ul>
      <li>Prior to reporting/discussing complaint, in writing state a concern of potential retaliation (provide examples of real possible negative outcomes you could face) and request written confirmation that any and all future communication regarding this concern be considered "protected activity" under the university anti-retalliation policy. You may request that a member of ER (HR) is present for the initial discussion of your complaint such that there is a formal confidential and protected record of your conversation.</li>
      <li>Prior to facilitated conversation with "offending party", request that the proposed possible solutions be run by you in advance. Request understanding of any and all limitations to solution.</li>
   </ul></p>
