<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>The ombudsman (for graduate students) were retired university faculty, trained in Georgia Tech policy and procedures, intended to be familiar with the GT system and yet external to it and therefore unbiased. However, the ombudsman program has been discontinued, and the title can now only be found in the ECE department. These ombudsmen are members of the ECE department who are available to provide answers to their students' concerns. The still-existing role that is now most similar to the original ombudsman role is the Assistant Vice Provost for Advocacy and Conflict-Resolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>Formerly listed on the Vice Provost's website, they can now only be found in the ECE department (with a slightly different job description).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>Go to an ombudsman to discover your options. The ombudsman is there to inform you about potential paths forward, but is not in a position to take an active role in any of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>Ombudsmen generally take promises of confidentiality seriously, although again there is no binding enforcement to be confidential.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome?</b></p>
   <p>The ombudsmen will respond to your request with a list of options and recommendations for conflict resolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>Send them an email either describing your concern or asking for a live meeting. If you are concerned about negative consequences that may arise if confidentiality is not kept, then prior to reporting/discussing your complaint with this person, state in writing your concerns, with examples of real possible negative outcomes you could face. Request written confirmation that any and all future communication regarding this concern be considered "protected activity" under the university anti-retaliation policy. You may request that a member of ER (HR) is present for the initial discussion of your complaint so that there is a formal, confidential and protected record of your conversation.</p>
