<p><b>Who is this person?</b></p>
   <p>This is the head of your department. It should be easy enough to find who this is for your department. If you happen to have an interim chair while a chair search is being conducted this might be a good person to skip over as they will not wield the same power (or won't be willing to for political reasons) as the actual chair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How can I find them?</b></p>
   <p>Their contact information should be publicly available on your department's website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When should I consider contacting this person?</b></p>
   <p>If you have not been able to resolve your conflict with your advisor or the Departmental Associate Chair of Graduate Studies/Student Services/Student Advocacy, you may choose to escalate your issue to the Chair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is speaking with this person confidential?</b></p>
   <p>It is this person's choice whether they choose to keep a conversation confidential, although you may request their discretion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Probable outcome:</b></p>
   <p>This solution will still be considered informal. Most likely the process will include conversations and communication that you are not privy to. This is because at this level conflict-resolution becomes potentially politically motivated for the faculty. Additionally, your chair might not know what they can/cannot do, so they might reach out to others to find out. This would be a good reason for you to have a specific request for a resolution and/or have sought the advice of an ombudsman or the VP for Conflict Resolution prior to reaching out, to find out what is possible.</p>
   <p>The chair has authority over your PhD Advisor, so while the Chair's solution may not have any explicit consequences for lack of follow-through, your advisor is likely motivated to respond as directed. Solutions at this level might include additional facilitated discussion with you and the offending party. The success of this resolution will hinge upon the administrator's conflict-resolution skills, their ability to be fair and unbiased, and both parties' willingness to participate in the suggested resolution. Resolutions at this level are not necessarily binding, so "offender" buy-in is critical.</p>
   <p>If departmental resources (co-advisor, TA-funding, facilities, etc.) can be leveraged to generate a potential solution this is a good path to pursue. If the political influence of the Chair might be enough to alleviate this situation this is a good option. Success is heavily dependent on who is the Chair, the Advisor, and/or the offending party.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How should I approach them?</b></p>
   <p>If you are concerned about negative consequences that may arise if confidentiality is not kept, then prior to reporting/discussing your complaint with this person, state in writing your concerns, with examples of real possible negative outcomes you could face. Request written confirmation that any and all future communication regarding this concern be considered "protected activity" under the university anti-retaliation policy. You may request that a member of ER (HR) is present for the initial discussion of your complaint so that there is a formal, confidential and protected record of your conversation.</p>
   <p>Prior to facilitated conversation with the offending party, request that the proposed possible solutions be run by you in advance. Request understanding of any and all limitations to the solution.</p>
   <p>E-mails are public record and therefore inherently non-confidential, but you can use them to your advantage. It is a good idea to write a follow-up e-mail to the chair outlining what was discussed, the plan moving forward, what the chair said they would do to help you, and any next steps you might need to take as well. Ask them to confirm your email or make corrections as needed. This can work to somewhat enforce people to keep their word and also serve as a record of the communication and arrangement should you need to cite it in the future.</p>
