<p>This is the head of your department. It should be easy enough to find who this is for your department. If you happen to have an interim chair while a chair search is being conducted this might be a good person to skip over as they will not wield the same power (or won’t be willing to for political reasons) as the actual chair.</p>
<p><b>Is speaking with them confidential?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">While it may be promised, there is no guarantee that a conversation with this person is confidential. There is no official protection or promise of confidentiality from the university at this level. Promises of confidentiality are worth as much as the word of the faculty serving in this role.</p>
<p><b>Is speaking with them considered "Protected Activity"?</b></p>
   <p class="answer">Your communication with administration at this level, whether it be verbal or in writing is not legally considered “protected activity” by the university. Ie. If you endure negative outcomes from reporting at this level, the university anti-retalliation policy will not protect you.</p>
<p><b>Likely solution?</b></p>
   <p><ul>
	<li>This solution will still be considered informal. Most likely the process will include conversations and communication that you are not privy to. This is because at this level conflict-resolution becomes potentially politically motivated for the faculty. Additionally, you chair might not know what they can/cannot do so they might reach out to others to find out. This would be a good reason for you to have a specific request for a resolution and/or have sought the advice of an ombudsmen prior to reaching out to this person to find out what is possible.</li>
	<li>The chair is the “Boss” of your PhD Advisor so while the proposed solution “enforced” by the chair isn’t actually binding your advisor is likely motivated not to make an enemy of their chair. This level might include additional facilitated discussion with you and the “offending” party. The success of this resolution will hinge upon the administrator’s conflict-resolution skills, the administrator’s ability to be fair and unbiased, and both parties' willingness to participate in the suggested resolution. Resolutions at this level are not binding so “offender” “buy-in” is critical.</li>
	<li>If departmental resources (co-advisor, TA-funding, facilities, etc.) can be leveraged to generate a potential solution this is a good path to pursue. If the political influence of the Chair might be enough to alleviate this situation this is a good option. Heavily dependent on who the chair is and who the advisor is.</li>
    </ul></p>
<p><b>What can I do?</b></p>
      <p><ul>
	<li>Prior to reporting/discussing complaint, in writing state a concern of potential retaliation (provide examples of real possible negative outcomes you could face) and request written confirmation that any and all future communication regarding this concern be considered “protected activity” under the university anti-retalliation policy. You may request that a member of ER (HR) is present for the initial discussion of your complaint such that there is a formal confidential and protected record of your conversation.</li>
	<li>Prior to facilitated conversation with “offending party”, request that the proposed possible solutions be run by you in advance. Request understanding of any and all limitations to solution.</li>
	<li>E-mails are public record and therefore inherently non-confidential, but you can use them to your advantage. It is a good idea to write a follow-up e-mail to the chair outlining what was discussed, the plan moving forward, what the chair said they would do to help you, and any next steps you might need to take as well. Ask them to confirm your email or make corrections as needed. This can work to somewhat enforce people to keep their word and also serve as a record of the communication and arrangement should you need to cite it in the future.</li>
