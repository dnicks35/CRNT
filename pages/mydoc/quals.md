                   <p class="answer">For almost all conflicts that you may encounter, there is no single correct point person to address your issue. You may enter the conflict-resolution process by taking your conflict to most levels of academic administration (up to the Dean's or Provost's office); however, the university "rule of thumb" is to handle conflicts at the lowest level of administration possible. The recommended path is as follows:</p>
