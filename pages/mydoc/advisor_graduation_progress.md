                   <p class="answer">For almost all conflicts that you may encounter, there is no single correct point person to address your issue. You may enter the conflict-resolution process by taking your conflict to most levels of academic administration (up to the Dean's or Provost's office); however, the university "rule of thumb" is to handle conflicts at the lowest level of administration possible. The recommended path is as follows:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                             <li><a href="associate_chair.html">Department Associate Chair for Graduate Studies</a></li>

                <p><b>Relevant Policies</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">There are many different sources of laws, policies, and codes of conduct that might apply to you as a graduate student (half employee/half student). Unfortunately GT does not have a centralized location for all their policies making them particularly hard to find. Furthermore, the university administration in place to help you resolve your conflict are not necessarily aware of relevant university or USG policies that might apply to your conflict and are almost certainly not trained in policy interpretation. Therefore, it can be important for you to know your rights and the policies in place to protect you prior to seeking administrative support resolving a conflict.
