<p>The website you see was created by and for Georgia Tech PhD students, to be an approachable, practical tool to help PhD students understand and access the resources that are available to help them navigate conflicts and concerns at our university. We have coordinated with provosts, administrators, and staff at the university to consolidate this information from across Georgia Tech's branching bureaucracy.</p> 

<p>Our tool includes general guidance for new students (see quick links on left), <A href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/directory.html">a directory of offices and personnel</A>, <A href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/policies.html">a list of policies that may apply to common complaints</A>, and most importantly, <A href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/problem-identification.html">a catalog of concerns and conflicts that students may encounter</A>. In all cases, we have endeavored not just to consolidate information, but to explain how and why these people and policies operate (in their own words, where possible) so that users can be empowered to understand their situation and their available options. We expect that the most valuable part of this website is in the <A href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/problem-identification.html">"Problem Identification and Solution Pathways"</A> page, where we have outlined 75+ (and counting!) conflicts and concerns and described the most direct pathways to solving them.</p>

<p>We recognize that no tool is perfect, and that universities are constantly evolving. If you have experienced a problem that is not in our catalog, or discovered that a part of our website is incomplete or out of date, <A href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/feedback">we welcome your feedback.</A> We are particularly interested in expanding this tool to better answer the needs of masters students and international students.</p>

<p>If you like what you see here and would like to be more involved, we welcome student volunteers, administrative advocates, and external funders. Contact us at the following link: <A href="https://memhc.me.gatech.edu/ourteam/">Get Involved</A>. If you are from another university and would like to use our website as a template for your own, you can fork this website from our GitHub page at <A href="https://github.com/dnicks35/CRNT">https://github.com/dnicks35/CRNT</A>. (Please let us know if you do!)</p>

<p>Whether you are a professor, staff member, provost, or student, we hope that this resource will help save you and those you interact with both time and stress. Please spread the word! Thank you for your efforts to streamline conflict resolution at Georgia Tech. </p>
