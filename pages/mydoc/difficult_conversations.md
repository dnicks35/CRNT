<p>“How” starts with “when”. As a general principle, earlier is better, but sometimes you would like to have a complete set of information to use to guide your conversation. Many other timing/approach recommendations will be based on what form of communication and level of trust the advisor/advisee have built.</p>
<h2>What foundation of communication/trust have you built with your advisor? </h2>
<p>Here are some examples of healthy communication patterns with your advisor:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular meetings, focused on specific topics. 
Where possible, align your interests with that of your advisor: </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Research meeting template: 1) a brief reminder/recap of your research goals, 2) any recent progress or results and what your planned next steps are, and 3) *the main point of the meeting* your current sticking points + what you would like to request your advisor's expertise on</li>
    <li>Career/graduation milestone meeting</li>
    <li>Concerns/conflicts meeting (is it better to have this as a separate meeting, or to sandwich it within a meeting that you already have a solid pattern for?)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>If you have healthy patterns of communication with your advisor (i.e. regular, respectful), that can make difficult conversations easier, but that doesn't mean they will always be easy. Advisors have a lot of power over a student's PhD experience, and many students would rather leave frustrations unspoken rather than risk creating an uncomfortable relationship with someone whom they will need to continue working with for the next many years / someone who has the authority to delay or block their dissertation milestones/degree, and someone who acts as a bridge/network to many potential future career options. Here are some ways to reframe this conversation so that it comes across as you being proactive, professional, and polite:</p>
