<p> Although we hope you can resolve your problems and continue to pursue your academic goals as planned, we recognize that not all situations have happy resolutions. On this page, we have included resources on how to cope with or leave an unhealthy environment. Your options may include counseling (either through GT's CARE office or external therapy), finding a new advisor or co-advisor, taking a leave of absence, converting to a different degree, or leaving Georgia Tech altogether.</p> 

<p>We hope that none of the more extreme responses will be necessary for you, but our hope is not a promise: we, the graduate students on the ME Mental Health Committee who built this tool, have each taken advantage of one or more of these options ourselves. We have done so in the hopes that the lines drawn and reports made by our complaints will make for a healthier environment for other students, who may or may not be able to take actions as extreme as ours.</p>
