<h2>HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE A PROBLEM?</h2>
<p> One of the difficulties in handling conflict resolution is that policies are written for neatly labeled issues, whereas lived experiences can be difficult to diagnose. Since grad school (and research in general) is expected to be rigorous and challenging, with high expectations and many ambiguities, it may be especially difficult to determine what difficulties are a natural part of the graduate student experience and which are pathological. Students may wonder, “Is my situation normal?” “Do I need to get better at handling this?” and “How do I ensure my success and well-being, given that there are no guarantees about the outcomes of the research I’m attempting?”</p>
<p> Research is full of ambiguities, but a university is intended to provide structure and mentorship that allows you to handle the unknown. All research involves struggle, but that struggle can be approached from a position of safety—financial safety, a foundation of prior research and techniques, social and reputational safety, reasonable time boundaries, and alternative avenues worthy of pursuit should your primary research thrust become untenable.</p>

<h2>OVERWHELM: A RED FLAG</h2>
<p>Whether or not a difficulty seems like your fault, someone else’s fault, or nobody’s fault, overwhelm is a key indicator that something is unsustainable. It is an indication that—regardless of the reasons why—you are in a state where you need help.</p>
<p>With the constant commotion and evolution of a graduate school program (or life in general), it’s common for new problems to arise as fast as old ones are dealt with, such that progress is constant but relief is distant. A chronic sense of overwhelm is normalized in grad school even more so than in the external world; its ubiquity does not mean that it is unimportant or that you do not need to look for assistance. Some of this help will come from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peers (social support, validation, contextualization, peer guidance and mentorship, stress relief)</li>
<li>University resources (STAMPS, CARE, Disability Office, Academic Advisement, Department governing bodies, Office of Student Integrity, VOICE, etc)</li>
<li>Advisor (career counseling, research plans and obstacles, funding plans…)</li>
<li>Staff and non-advisor faculty (grad school planning, mentorship, contextualization, networking…)</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this help may be to strengthen you to handle your situation, to provide temporary support so that you can regain your normal level of health and productivity, and/or to make changes in your external environment in order to make it more manageable.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>In no case</strong> should there be ethical issues concerning the treatment of individuals in your lab, use of funds, research procedures, research validity, etc. If you know of any ethical issues in or outside of your lab, you can immediately report them to <A href="https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/7508/index.html">EthicsPoint</A> (be sure to save your complaint number!) for the University to evaluate and route your complaint, or you can consult our <A href="https://www.derek-nichols.com/CRNT/problem-identification.html">“Conflicts and Concerns”</A> library in order to determine 1) if the situation requires further observation, investigation, or intervention, and 2) the most direct and effective pathway(s) to do so.
