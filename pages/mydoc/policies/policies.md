                    <p class="answer">Title IX is a federal law, not a GT policy. Title IX prohibits institutions that receive federal funding from practicing gender discrimination in educational programs or activities. There are no specific Title IX policies at GT, but several policies cover Title IX issues, such as Sexual Misconduct Policy, USG Policy to Prohibit Discrimination and Harassment, Equal Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy, Retaliation Policy, Student Code of Conduct, and Employee Code of Conduct. The Title IX Office is trained to handle the special cases of these policies when they specifically relate to gender-based discrimination.</p>

                <p><b>Summary</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">Technically, you should be protected from retaliation when you file a complaint or grievance or report policy violations in good faith. However, retaliation is usually hard to prove for graduate students unless it is very obvious. Demonstrating negative actions against you is not enough. You must also prove that these negative actions are a direct result of you making a complaint. Detailed records of retaliatory actions are imperative here.</p>
                <p><b>Policy Description</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Retaliation against any employee, who, in good faith, files a complaint or grievance; seeks the aid of Human Resources; testifies or participates in investigations, compliance reviews, proceedings or hearings; or opposes actual or perceived violations of policy or unlawful acts is strictly forbidden. This policy does not protect an employee who provides information that she or he knows is false, files a bad faith retaliation claim, or participates in any illegal conduct. Georgia Tech will take timely and appropriate action, up to and including dismissal, against any employee who violates this non-retaliation policy."</li>
                            <li>"Retaliation is any materially adverse action taken or threatened against an employee because the employee has, in good faith, filed a complaint or grievance; sought the aid of Human Resources; testified or participated in investigations, compliance reviews, proceedings or hearings; or opposed actual or perceived violations of policy or unlawful acts."</li>

                   <p class="answer">For almost all conflicts that you may encounter, there is no single correct point person to address your issue.
