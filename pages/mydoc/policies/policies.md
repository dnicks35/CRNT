                <p><b>Summary</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">Technically, you should be protected from retaliation when you file a complaint or grievance or report policy violations in good faith. However, retaliation is usually hard to prove for graduate students unless it is very obvious. Demonstrating negative actions against you is not enough. You must also prove that these negative actions are a direct result of you making a complaint. Detailed records of retaliatory actions are imperative here.</p>
                <p><b>Policy Description</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">"Retaliation against any employee, who, in good faith, files a complaint or grievance; seeks the aid of Human Resources; testifies or participates in investigations, compliance reviews, proceedings or hearings; or opposes actual or perceived violations of policy or unlawful acts is strictly forbidden. This policy does not protect an employee who provides information that she or he knows is false, files a bad faith retaliation claim, or participates in any illegal conduct. Georgia Tech will take timely and appropriate action, up to and including dismissal, against any employee who violates this non-retaliation policy."</p>
                    <p class="answer">"Retaliation is any materially adverse action taken or threatened against an employee because the employee has, in good faith, filed a complaint or grievance; sought the aid of Human Resources; testified or participated in investigations, compliance reviews, proceedings or hearings; or opposed actual or perceived violations of policy or unlawful acts."</p>

                <p><b>Summary</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">This policy ensures the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) complies with applicable law and University System of Georgia policy in providing leave to eligible employees under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Employees are eligible to take FMLA leave if they have worked at least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months. This equates to 24 hours per week, which is above the "official" max workload of 20 hours per week for grad students. <b>Therefore, grad students are not eligible</b> regardless of how many hours you work.</p>
                <p><b>Policy Description</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job protected leave each year. An employee must be employed for at least one year and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months. Eligible employees may use FMLA leave intermittently or in one continuous block for the following reasons:</p>
                    <p class="answer">Birth or placement of a child (for adoption or foster care):</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>The employee's own serious health condition or to provide care for the employee's child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition</li>
                            <li>Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient hospital care, hospice, or residential medical care facility</li>
                            <li>Any period of incapacity, sporadic absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by a health care provider.</li>
                            <li>Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity.</li>

                            <li>When a qualifying exigency arises because the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty status. Qualifying exigencies leave may include: short-notice deployment (7 days notice or less and only available for 7 days total), military events and related activities (such as ceremonies and briefings), child care and school activities (for non-routine matters), financial and legal arrangements, counseling, rest and relaxation (up to 5 days), post-deployment activities (including debriefings or funeral services for up to 90 days following the termination of the covered military member's active duty status), and any additional activities agreed upon by the Institute and employee.</li>

                    <p class="answer">Military Caregiver Leave:</p>

                            <li>Eligible employees who are the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entitled to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for the service member. Military caregiver leave is available during a single 12-month period during which an eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks of FMLA leave. A single 12-month period begins on the 1st day the employee takes military leave and ends 12 months later.</li>

                    <p class="answer">GRAs and GTAs are not required to work on institute holidays. They must ask their supervisor to approve <b>any</b> time off. The advisor is responsible for keeping the workload within the number of hours paid, and the grad assistants are responsible for working the correct number of hours designated for the assignment. If you believe this policy has been violated, first approach the responsible individual, and then work your way up the chain of authority as long as the issue persists.</p>
                <p><b>Policy Description</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">GRAs and GTAs are not required to work on official Institute holidays, which appear on the Human Resources website. In addition, at the discretion of the student's supervisor, a GRA or GTA may be permitted to average effort over several weeks or cluster research or teaching activities in order to spend one or more weeks away from campus during the semester or, more frequently, during periods when classes are not in session. Any time away requires the approval of the supervisor. This flexibility may be used to allow later start dates for students new to campus. Some work assignments may not permit this flexibility.</p>
                    <p class="answer">GRAs or GTAs appointed to sponsored research projects should monitor their appointments monthly in the Electronic Workload Assignment Form (EWAF), because they will be required to sign an Annual Statement of Reasonableness indicating that the effort they put into projects was correctly recorded. </p>
                    <p class="answer">The supervisor is responsible for keeping the student's actual workload within the number of hours paid and allowing reasonable flexibility in fulfilling work responsibilities.</p>
                    <p class="answer">The graduate assistant is responsible for working the number of hours designated for the assignment, requesting flexibility when needed, and abiding by the determination of the supervisor with regard to flexibility requests.</p>
                    <p class="answer">Students who believe this policy has been violated should first approach the individual responsible for the violation to resolve the issue. If the violation persists, the situation should be reported to the head of the next level up from the violation (e.g., school chair or laboratory head in the case of violations by supervisors; deans or institute directors for laboratories) or to the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Affairs.</p>

                    <p class="answer">Research and teaching assistantships provide work experiences for graduate students that contribute to their education. Research assistantships involve tasks such as setting up equipment, gathering and analyzing data, participating in research team interaction and training, and writing up and presenting results. Teaching assistantships involve activities such as planning and delivering classes, laboratories, or online educational experiences, grading, and evaluating the teaching and learning experience.</p>
                    <p class="answer">The work done under a graduate research or teaching assistantship should enhance the student's educational experience. Research grants may not be used for teaching assistantships unless the grant terms specifically allow it.

                <p><b>Summary</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">The Non-Discrimination policy prohibits both discrimination, discriminatory harassment (when discriminatory conduct creates a hostile environment), and sexual harassment. Discriminatory harassment will lead to more significant action, but it is hard to prove and sets a high bar to reach. Discrimination is even harder to prove because the offending conduct is even more subtle. To prove either, keep detailed records of instances of discrimination and harassment. Digital records of texts and emails or voice records will help your case. Some harassment may also violate the workplace violence policy. Unfortunately, building a strong enough case here may require enduring discrimination for a long period of time. Other avenues for resolution may be more effective.</p>

                    <p class="answer">This policy prohibits discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and sexual/gender harassment:</p>

                <p><b>Summary</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">This policy details the entire process regarding scholarly conduct accusations. Report observed, suspected, or apparent misconduct in science to the Provost or Executive Vice-President for Research. If you are unsure whether a suspected incident constitutes scholarly misconduct, you may call the VP-LA&RM to discuss the suspected misconduct informally.</p>
                <p><b>Policy Description</b></p>
                    <p class="answer">This policy and the associated procedures apply to all individuals at Georgia Tech engaged in research or other scholarly activity regardless of the source of funding for the activity including but not limited to funding or proposed funding from federal sources (see References 1 and 2). This policy applies to any person paid by, under the control of, or affiliated with the institution, such as scientists, trainees, technicians and other staff members, students, fellows, guest researchers, or collaborators with or at Georgia Tech. The policy and associated procedures will normally be followed when an allegation of possible misconduct in science is received by an institutional official. Particular circumstances in an individual case may dictate variation from the normal procedure deemed in the best interests of Georgia Tech and the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS). Any change from normal procedures also must ensure fair treatment to the subject of the inquiry or investigation. Any significant variation should be approved in advance by the Provost of Georgia Tech.</p>
                    <p class="answer">This policy and the procedural requirements involved in handling allegations of scientific or other scholarly misconduct are intended to be sensitive to the varied demands made on those who conduct research and other scholarly activities, those who are accused of misconduct, and those who report apparent misconduct in good faith.</p>
                    <p class="answer">This policy does not replace or supersede the Academic Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct found in the Georgia Institute of Technology General Catalog (see Reference 3) for students subject to that policy, except when the alleged scientific or other scholarly misconduct occurs in sponsor supported activities.</p>

                    <p class="answer">The Code is not written with the specificity of a criminal statute and should not be confused with criminal law. Institute conduct proceedings are not restricted by the rules of evidence governing criminal and civil proceedings. Students may be charged under multiple sections of the Student Code of Conduct (Non-Academic Misconduct, the Academic Misconduct) based upon the same conduct. Students may be held accountable both to civil or criminal authorities and the Institute for acts that constitute violations of law and the Policy. Proceedings under this Policy may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings. Students who reside in Institute housing are subject to Housing policies and procedures in addition to this Code.</p>
