<p>First order of business: did the situation occur in the graduate student's role as student or employee?</p>
<ul>
<li>The first order of business is to determine whether the situation applies to a graduate student who is acting in their student or employee role. There are policies that apply to employees, and policies that apply to students, and graduate students fall into both categories. Determining whether and which policies apply in a given situation is the first hurdle, and may affect which office/policy you appeal to. (If you can determine this  yourself, you may be able to save yourself from thrashing between departments or offices.)</li>

<li> To be an "employee" of Georgia Tech means that you're on a GT payroll. Unfortunately, this may mean that fellowship students do not fall into the employee category, and thus do not have the protections associated with employee-related policies. <i>(Is there anything special about GRA positions? I know fellowships are outside of GT's payroll, but are there grants that can result in this situation as well?)</i></li>
</ul>


<p>Describe the criteria for which GT will initiate disciplinary action (a policy, code, or legal violation) vs the situations which GT will respond to via mediated discussions or warnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy, code, or legal violations require disciplinary action. Georgia Tech reserves the right to use “progressive disciplinary action,” which scales the intensity of the university’s response based on the severity of the crime and whether it is a first-time occurance.</li>
<ul>
<li>Note that discrimination and retaliation can elevate otherwise minor complaints to the status of a policy violation. However, the burden of proof is on the complainant to show that treatment was due to being a member of a protected class, or due to a policy violation report they made or contributed to.</li>
</ul>
<li>Behavior that a reasonable person would object to, but is not specifically prohibited by a code or policy, will be addressed through discussion. This may be a discussion between you and the offending party, mediated by a university official, or a warning from the university to the offending party. The kinds of objectionable behaviors that the university will assist with include violations of a Mutual Expectations document (https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/graduate/expectations/), behaviors that do not align with the USG Code of Conduct mandate for treating others with dignity and respect, and any of the behaviors listed as problematic under the General Work Rules Policy (https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/employment/general-work-rules). The General Work Rules policy was written to codify some of the common issues that </li>
</ul>
<p>Georgia Tech responses and what they will look like to you, as a complainant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Progressive Disciplinary Action (https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/employment/progressive-discipline ):</li>
<li>Verbal or written warning</li>
<li>Suspension without pay</li>
<li>Termination</li>
<li>*include timeline ranges here*</li>
</ul>
<p>One reason to start the conflict resolution process is to draw attention to a problematic situation—to draw a line in the sand. This is risky to you, as the university will only take action when an official line has been crossed, and if you are the first to ask for that line to be drawn, you are in a vulnerable situation. However, once the line has been drawn or a specific individual has been given a warning, the official record created will allow future complaints to be acted on much more readily. </p>

<p>Because of the vulnerable place it may put you in to be the first to complain about a particular situation, we have included resources on how to cope with or leave an unhealthy environment. </p>
