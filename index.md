<p>
    Welcome to the Georgia Tech Conflict Resolution Navigator Tool. The website you see was created by the <a href="https://memhc.me.gatech.edu/">ME Graduate Mental Health Committee</a> in order to streamline the resolution of common PhD student conflicts and concerns. We designed this website to be a tool for both graduate students and those who work with them. We hope that by presenting this information in a central, easy-to-navigate web tool, we can connect members of the Georgia Tech community to the resources available to them and reduce the time, confusion, and distress that conflict resolution can often involve.</p>

<p>
    While our focus in this phase is on issues experienced by graduate students (more specifically, PhD students), we hope that the Conflict Resolution Navigator Tool can be someday expanded to include problems experienced by other parties at Georgia Tech. If you have feedback or information for us, please send it via the <a href="feedback" class="btn btn-primary"> provided form</a>. If you like our work and would like to get in touch with us, please see our group website, <a href = "https://memhc.me.gatech.edu/contact-us/">here</a>. We welcome any who would like to get involved with the ME MHC, create your own website modeled after this one, or donate to GT's Woodruff Strong Campaign.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for contributing to our efforts to streamline conflict resolution at Georgia Tech.

<p><b>How to use this tool:</b></p>
<p class="answer">Search manually through the tree or by using the search bar at the top of the page to search for a conflict through keywords. Each conflict has a "Chain of Command for Conflict Resolution". It is best to start the conflict resolution process at the lowest level possible, but any should be able to help get your conflict resolved. Click on each office to determine what you can do to work with that office and what will be the likely solution.</p>
